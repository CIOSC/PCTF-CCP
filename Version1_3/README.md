1. Consolidated Overview PDF Version Word Version
2. Assessment Worksheet [XLSX Version]

This version is based on the recommendations outlined in the PSP PCTF Working Group Close Out Report presented to JEDI on December 10, 2020, specifically:  
1. Continue the development of the PSP PCTF 
2. Continue the application of the PSP PCTF through the Assessment Process

Work Item Activities
Continue to address the following thematic issues with updates as required to establish the PSP PCTF Version 1.3:
1.	Thematic Issue 1: Relationships. The development of a relationship model
2.	Thematic Issue 2: Credentials. The development of a credential model
Review of the PSP PCTF Conformance Criteria with the following objectives:
1.	A global review and ‘refresh’ of the conformance criteria considering the most recent version of the PCTF. Many of the conformance criteria have been unchanged since PCTF Alpha version (c.2016) and are no longer appropriate. This includes removing criteria that are too prescriptive (certain tech) or are repetitive to what already exists in related guidance and standards (security, privacy, etc.)
2.	Integration of organization and relationship entities and atomic processes into the conformance criteria. This involves reviewing the conformance criteria to determine if they can be applied to one or several of the entities, revising, removing, and adding criteria as appropriate
Outputs (and Estimated Time Frame)
The activities of these work items support the following outputs, all of which will be brought forward to JEDI on a periodic basis to update or request approval:
1.	PSP PCTF Consolidated Overview Version 1.3 (Feb 2021 Consultation Draft)
2.	PSP PCTF Conformance Criteria Version 1.3 (Feb 2021 Consultation Draft)
3.	Lesson Learned/Insights from assessment processes to onboard jurisdictions for persons, organizations and relationships informing next steps and direction for advancing the PSP PCTF. (Timeframes are dependent on projects such as ISED’s Business Banking Digital Credentials Pilots and TBS’ MyAlberta Digital ID Re-Assessment)
